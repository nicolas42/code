My name is Grant Sanderson. Videos here cover a variety of topics in math, or adjacent fields like physics and CS, all with an emphasis on visualizing the core ideas. The goal is to use animation to help elucidate and motivate otherwise tricky topics, and for difficult problems to be made simple with changes in perspective.

30X40 Design Workshop
@30by40•1.14M subscribers
I make videos about architecture, design simple modern homes + share the process behind the making of architecture. Architecture tutorials, portfolio and design advice for students and professionals, architecture short courses, sketching and drawing workshops, architectural essays, product + book reviews. Videos revealing the thinking, the process and the ideas behind the making of architecture with a focus on residential design. It's an inside look into a growing architecture practice on a small island in Maine. 30X40 Design Workshop was founded, Eric Reinholdt, an award-winning architect, entrepreneur, and author of the "Architect + Entrepreneur" book series. He's an avid mountain hiker, father, husband, guitar player, documentary film fan, home brewer and native New Yorker. My practice is headquartered in a custom designed "Long Studio" on Mount Desert Island just off the coast of Maine, home to Acadia National Park. Here I design simple, modern custom homes of all scales.

What makes you a heretic? Fallen BBC presenter Andrew Gold believes we're in an age of group-think and tribes, and need heretics - those who use unconventional wisdom to speak out against their own groups, from cancelled comedians and radical feminists to cult defectors and vigilantes hunting deviants. This is YouTube for intelligent adults capable of plurality of opinion and considered dissent. Sponsors: David@modernstoa.co Learn from Andrew's guests how to rebel, think differently and resist social contagion. From Triggernometry's Francis Foster and the world's most cancelled man Graham Linehan to ex-Hasidic Jew Julia Haart and gender critical atheist Richard Dawkins.

Welcome!

I'm studying Aerospace Engineering at UT Austin (Hook 'Em!) and this channel is also the perfect opportunity for me to solidify the concepts and applications I've dedicated myself to over the last few years. For now, my main series is Science and Engineering in KSP, but stay tuned, because I may branch out sometime in the future! SEKSP is a weekly show that applies and tests the fundamental concepts of space flight in Kerbal Space Program, with uploads appearing every weekend.

Arrow of Entropy
@ArrowofEntropy•1.15K subscribers
Arrow of Entropy is a YouTube channel intended to explain abstract topics from mathematics and physics in an accessible manner. Currently we've started our first series on Geometric Algebra (GA), a mathematical framework with the potential of replacing linear algebra in many physics and (computer) engineering problems. In this framework every algebraic expression has a very clear geometrical meaning and vice versa, allowing us to solve math problems using our visual cortex instead of wherever math normally happens. This should appeal to visual thinkers everywhere. Or if you prefer it the other way, just turn that geometrical problem into an algebraic one.

CircuitBread is all about electronics and electrical engineering tutorials, with content on how electronics work and some extras for fun! There are many topics that we want to get through and while we’re planning on starting with basic electronics and microcontrollers, we have plans for a wide range of practical and theoretical videos on AC and DC circuits, microelectronics, electronic devices, semiconductor devices, communications systems, robotics, control systems, digital logic, electromagnetic theory, and… well, probably more, but that’s quite the list as it is. Mixed in with tutorials, we want more lighthearted stuff - tradeshows, faires, spotlights on people and companies, parodies, etc. This content will appeal to anyone with an interest in electronics and electrical engineering and, while passionate, doesn’t take themselves (or us!) too seriously. So, subscribe and follow us on this adventure as we learn more about electronics together and have a little fun while doing it!

I am one of four passionate physics teachers at Webster Groves High School in St. Louis, MO. I teach AP Physics 1 and 2, but I teach calculus with the class as well, since physics makes no sense without it. I use Walker's excellent textbook, Physics 2nd Edition. My videos are organized into playlists for each chapter of that book, and really should be watched sequentially if you have the time. I try to align my class with a first-year physics class at top universities. You may find the videos useful for tutoring and review. Please do problems immediately after watching a video. This is how you will become a stronger physicist. Some people have been asking to support my work with beer. Money can be more easily sent, so please feel free to send me some at the GoFundMe page link below. I'll be very grateful if you do - my dog pooped in my wife's new handbag. Also, let me know if a video is particularly unhelpful - I will redo it when I have time.

Everyday Astronaut
@EverydayAstronaut•1.63M subscribers
Rocket science. A term we all use to describe something incredibly difficult. Trying to grasp all of the concepts involved in rocket science can be incredibly intimidating. My name’s Tim Dodd but I'm better known as the Everyday Astronaut. Recently I fell head over heels in love with spaceflight. My appreciation and curiosity for the subject grew into an obsession. Before you knew it, all I wanted to do was learn more and more... the more I learned, the more I wanted to share what was making me so excited. But as someone who dropped out of college and has no technical background or degree… I really felt unqualified for the job of explaining rocket science to anyone. But the fact of the matter is, if I can learn this stuff, anyone can. Rocket science is awesome, and you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to be excited. Everyday Astronaut. Bringing space down to Earth for everyday people.

They may have been enlighten rulers or vile despots; great builders or the destroyers of civilization - but they all shared one thing. They were human, and as such they had hopes, dreams, aspirations, inner demons, and insecurities - like everyone else. These traits affected the course of humanity for better and for worse. Together, they have made us the global society we are today. Flash Point History is dedicated to making history accessible because when we look into the past we discover ourselves.

Bardcore for the discerning clergyman, noble, or muck-gathering peasant. I am a Canadian singer/illustrator who started making Bardcore in the Spring of 2020. If you're new to Bardcore, it is a pastiche genre that takes modern songs and makes them "old-timey" through the use of Medieval and Renaissance inspired instrumentation, as well as Shakespearean-ish lyrics. Unless otherwise credited, the majority of the instrumentals were created by me. They feature a mix of virtual and real instruments, including the Celtic harp, Irish whistle, and recorder. Several videos feature my brother, known here as Friar Funk. Looking to use my music in a non-profit video, play, podcast, video game mod, etc? Please go ahead so long as you provide proper credit to any of the artists included on the track. Feel free to send me an email to let me know where it's been used! Lastly, I don’t take private commissions, but I am open to collaborating on projects that fit my niche.

History With Hilbert
@historywithhilbert146•474K subscribers
Hello everyone, my name's Hilbert and I make videos about (mostly) history, hence the name.Which period of history and which aspect of location can vary greatly, from the Picts of 6th Century Scotland to the Peaky Blinders of 1920's Birmingham, although you can be sure that whichever time period I am talking about, it will include some (mostly useless) language and etymological trivia as well as the national anthem of the Netherlands. Do not question this; it is essential to being a good historian. The best "About" section you can find on me and not written by me are my videos, so if you want to learn more about me why not watch them? If you still want to learn more then consider jumping into my private life on Vlogs in Clogs, or following my various social media accounts like Facebook or Twitter, and if you want to pay me to ramble about history and languages and sitting in my room fantasising about windmills; you now can thanks to popular demand by becoming a patron on Patreon.

Introduction to Cryptography by Christof Paar
@introductiontocryptography4223•62.1K subscribers
The 24 lectures give a comprehensive introduction to modern applied crypto. Only high school math is required to follow the lectures. The videos are mostly self-contained, i.e., you should be able to follow most of the material without additional resources. However, we recommend the course textbook, "Understanding Cryptography" by Christof Paar and Jan Pelzl. Please see www.crypto-textbook.com The English version of the crypto lectures was taught in the 2010/11 academic year at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany. We have Europe's largest programs in IT security, with 200+ new bachelor and master students annually. The videos show the two-semester introductory courses for our B.Sc. and the M.Sc. IT security students. There is *no* tution for either program, however, students must pass a German language exam (sorry). More on RUB: www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/index_en.htm As an excellent learning tool, we highly recommend: www.cryptool.org.

My travels took me to over 75 different countries, allowed me to learn lots about the beautiful world we live in and meet lots of wonderful people. I'm forever grateful for this experience and I'm happy I managed to record a few of my travels to share with the world. I hope my videos will inspire more young people to travel the world and live life on their own terms. After all... life's short, why waste a second?

Jeremy Balka's statistics channel, containing some introductory statistics videos. (I am an associate professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Guelph. I have a PhD in statistics, and have taught introductory statistics courses on many occasions.) I try to be concise, and use real data in the vast majority of cases. Some of these videos move at a quick pace, especially my earlier ones, and they are not designed to be lecture replacements. They may serve to clarify some concepts after lecture. If you want to get ahead, watch the relevant videos before lecture to get an introduction to the topic. The videos are pitched at the level of an applied introductory statistics course to non-statistics majors. I'll be updating this channel with new videos until I've filled out a full introductory statistics course (and I may possibly expand after that). A complete list of videos, organized by topic, can be found at www.jbstatistics.com.

My mission is to make learning advanced music accessible to anyone who's willing to put in the work. I hate the word talent. It downplays the power of hard work. It wasn’t until the summer after my freshman year in high school that I showed any real promise or progress on the saxophone. It was in that summer that I started practicing eight hours a day, transposing Charlie Parker solos in all 12 keys. Charlie Parker practiced 15 hours a day. So annoying. When I'm not making videos, I teach Skype lessons to people in time zones all over the world. I also compose music for film, television, and advertising with a client list that includes NASA, CNN, Google, Gatorade, Ferrari, and many more. A graduate of New England Conservatory (‘09), I also hold a Master of Music degree in Jazz Composition and Arranging from UMASS Amherst.

Learn jazz guitar and learn how to make music with what you learn. Videos that show you how things work, and also how you use them in your own playing because what is great about learning Jazz is that you become able to play Jazz and make music. In 2014 I was happy working as a jazz guitarist and touring with my Band Træben, but I was mostly teaching Metallica, Coldplay and AC/DC. Of course there is nothing wrong with those genres of music, but I really wanted to teach Jazz so I started writing some lessons on my website. After publishing a few on Ultimate Guitar, I was adviced by Chris Zoupa to start making YouTube videos (if you like the videos you should really Thank him). As you can see that turned out to be a lot of fun!

This channel seeks to understand the issues that face our civilisation in the 21st Century and focusses on the potential solutions that will save as many lives as possible and hopefully bring about a greater level of equality in the world. The channel is not a debating forum about whether Human Induced Climate Change is a real phenomenon or not. If that's what you're after then I can highly recommend chat forums on Social Media, where people on both sides of the argument go round and round in circles achieving precisely nothing at all. That is a mug's game. And it's not my game. Anyway, outside of those caveats, I do try to keep it light and humorous wherever possible, so I hope you enjoy the content. Oh..and me... Dave Borlace.

Welcome to my Channel. I try to do researched content about various topics ranging from history, anthropology, geography, culture and more and more and more. I have a long list, and yeah I actually have a list of videos that I want to make in the future. I constantly update that list and post it in the community tab monthly. My patreons then vote on which topic comes next. The process by which I currently work is to make a short video (about 12-30 minutes long) followed by a long video (about 1-2 hours long) and to try to do two videos a month. I hope you enjoy what I have made if you want to leave feedback or criticism and you want me to see it, there is a feedback tab on my discord server where I read and take note on what my audience believes should be changed,or what I got wrong, or take suggestions for topics. If you want to suggest a topic, leave feedback or support me via paypal or patreon, the links are below. If you want to contact me in person the best way is through discord.

Hey guys, I am the lead developer for Seed Of Andromeda, and I created this channel to help people learn to make games! I am working on several tutorial series targeted at teaching an absolute beginner to programming. We will learn C++ and OpenGL, and we will even even create our own game engine from scratch! Eventually, we will be making a voxel engine similar to Seed Of Andromeda. The tutorials are very clear and engaging, and you will have the opportunity to participate in several challenge videos where I challenge you to make a small game. If you ever get stuck on a tutorial or have any questions, simply send me a PM or post a comment on a video and I will help you out!

Hi Everyone, My name is MangoldProject (well, it's really Assaf), and I'm here to help you become a better piano or keyboard player, and a better musician overall! I've been playing the keys for over 20 years now and I enjoy sharing what I've learned. Getting a deep understanding of the keyboard and of music theory is a long process and I hope these videos will inspire you and maybe give you that extra insight that will help you push your own envelope. All of my lessons now feature an on-screen keyboard, clear labeling, an on-screen score and, of course, my own special take on each topic. I cover both beginning and more advanced topics. My channel is free to watch and I hope it helps you out! If you want to help, please consider paying my sister's online ETSY jewelry store a visit (there's a link down below and in most of my newer videos). She's a talented artist who I'm proud to support: https://www.etsy.com/shop/daphneartjewelry Enjoy!

Hey hey! My name is Marcus House and I like space stuff. I hope to help you like space stuff too assuming you don't already. Eight years before I was born, Apollo 17 returned from the moon (1972). I sadly missed the most exciting adventure humans have ever experienced. Since I was young I've dreamed of being able to witness the next big milestone. We've seen no further manned missions outside Low Earth Orbit in my years, but this is about to change with SpaceX and Blue Origin pushing humanity back into the new space race alongside NASA. Other wonderful new companies such as Rocketlab are increasing the excitement with smaller payloads as well. This is an amazing time to be alive and I want to share all I can with you. Historically I'm a huge fan of Kerbal Space Program (KSP) which is where my Youtube channel started. KSP2 is around the corner, so we may well get back into that at some point soon as well.

Hello my name is Michael. I’ve always had this curiosity of wanting to understand how things innately came about. When I heard that mathematics had a lot to do with where we are today as a civilization, I was drawn to it and perplexed. “How is it possible that math can get us to the point we are now?” I began to read about the history of mathematics from the time of Pythagoras to Newton. I began to do more mathematics. The more I did math the more curious I got. I wanted to know where the formulas came from; I wanted to get an intuitive understanding of how it all worked. Ultimately I wanted to know, “What is mathematics?” And that’s why I got my degree in math. I’m still going through my journey of discovering more, but I also like sharing what I’ve learned. I’ve made these animated videos while I was in college to inspire others to understand math. I am currently in my third year of teaching Algebra 2. FAQ: "What software do you use?" I use adobe flash, maya and imovie

MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY
@Medcram•1.56M subscribers
Clinicians and students deserve better medical education! We’ve sat through dense PowerPoint lectures with way too much info crammed into each slide and wondered... are we supposed to read all this and listen to the instructor at the same time? We’ve spent hours studying a new topic — only to get frustrated weeks later when we can’t recall the key ideas. We’ve received “textbook” medical explanations that often lack clinical context and fail to highlight the most important concepts. MedCram.com offers a dramatically more efficient, engaging, fun, and lasting way to learn and review medical topics. MedCram was founded in 2012 by Dr. Roger Seheult and one of his former PA students, Kyle Allred, with one word in mind: CLARITY Join over 1,500,000 clinicians and students who’ve utilized MedCram to: - Become a better clinician - Score better on exams - Cut down on study time - Get CME, CE, MOC points (over 60 hours) MedCram = More Clarity, in Less Time Media Contact: see email below

Missing Semester
@MissingSemester•96K subscribers
Classes teach you all about advanced topics within CS, from operating systems to machine learning, but there’s one critical subject that’s rarely covered, and is instead left to students to figure out on their own: proficiency with their tools. We’ll teach you how to master the command-line, use a powerful text editor, use fancy features of version control systems, and much more! Students spend hundreds of hours using these tools over the course of their education (and thousands over their career), so it makes sense to make the experience as fluid and frictionless as possible. Mastering these tools not only enables you to spend less time on figuring out how to bend your tools to your will, but it also lets you solve problems that would previously seem impossibly complex.

During domestic festivals, it's a bit more showy but apart from that, this is a contact sport with weapons. We train western style fighting and include upper arms in the kill zone because it is simply safer and slightly less silly. These videos are mostly for us to review and improve ourselves but they are open to anyone who might enjoy them.

My name is Neal Hallinan. I'm a Postural Restoration Institute credentialed strength and conditioning coach, licensed massage therapist (New Jersey) and perhaps most importantly, someone who suffered from chronic pain through most of my adult life. This channel was created to help you understand why the science of Postural Restoration is the best explanation for how you move, breathe, and stabilize your body whenever you are upright. Simply put, when we can no longer move, breathe, and stabilize properly, we end up compensating and it's the compensations that eventually lead to pain. Postural Restoration works by restoring your body's natural patterns of movement in order to eliminate these painful compensations. I overcame chronic and debilitating pain to live a happy, productive, and fulfilling life. You can, too. If you decide you'd like personalized help, I offer some limited on-line Zoom consultations. https://pritrainer.com/on-line-consultations/

Capturing the natural beauty of chemistry I find that chemistry is often taught poorly or without a purpose. Because of this, people tend to lose interest and sometimes even start to hate it. In each video that I make, I try to balance theory with purpose. My goal is to capture the natural beauty of chemistry in fun and interesting ways. In terms of education, I have a BSc in Biochemistry, with a minor in pharmacology. However, I've always been a lot more drawn to applied chemistry. So after finishing my degree, I worked as a lab tech in an organic lab, and then as a chemistry grad student. However, I ended up leaving my graduate studies early to focus on this channel. Now, making chemistry videos has become my full-time job! Sponsorships and related business inquiries: nilered@endcard.com Other inquiries: admin@nilered.ca

Return to sanity with Spectrum Street Epistemology & conversations This channel has a two-fold aim: first, to restore free speech and open inquiry as non-partisan values; and second, to reveal the implications of far-left ideological takeover. Truth is no longer the North Star of our universities. However, addressing what goes on in university classrooms is not nearly enough. Students indoctrinated with intolerant ideologies are now teachers in primary education, human resource officers in organizations and corporations, and DEI consultants across the globe. Equally damaging is the woke infiltration of journalism, where the aims of objectivity and balance have been replaced by ideology and activism.

I make videos showing you a world that the media fails to capture. No BS polarization or political angle—just pure authentic interactions with the locals. I present the story. You present your own opinion. We'll learn about the people of Appalachia, the Chicanos, and the Native Americans. I dive into the full range of America, from the Amish to the Bloods and Crips. The goal is to get into someone else’s world to understand them and ourselves better. The ingredients are: a GoPro, simple editing, curiosity, a search for truth, and most importantly, authentic human interactions. I’ve lived abroad in four countries and traveled to 85. I've taken this perspective back to the USA to show Americans and the world what this great nation is like away from the mainstream media.

Oddly enough the channel is about empowerment. It is my belief that with creativity, experimentation and a get up and go attitude anything can be achieved. Link that with the use of local resources and a reduced need for expensive tools and equipment then you have empowerment and the ability to do anything for yourself if you need to. Don't get me wrong you don't have to do everything by yourself but I think you should be able to if you want to or need to.

A while ago I posted a short video of the results of a robot being driven around manually while recording range data with a spinning distance sensor. Several people had asked for me to post my code. I didn't write all of that code though so I decided to create a new robot that I could use as a test bench which would do a similar thing but with entirely my own code. The previous robot used a map that was essentially a bitmap. The big problem with that is that you can't have too big of a map. This new robot will save the original scans along with the location where the scan was taken. If a map is needed, one can be generated from those scans at whatever grid size you want within whatever bounds you want. Code will be located here: https://github.com/jack-buffington/mappingRobot I'll be posting some videos periodically from now on talking about my progress and how things work at that time.

I am an astrophysicist and in my free time I like to make visualizations of all things science. While certainly astronomy and physics is closer to me than other sciences, I have a wide interest in other natural sciences as well. I often make info-graphics or visualizations of topics that I have a hard time finding easily available pictures or animations of, or just simply find them very interesting. Here is my flickr account where you can find my illustrations: https://www.flickr.com/people/188522613@N05/

Scott Manley is someone who fell into youtube because he felt a deep compelling need to teach people orbital mechanics and rocket science so they could play Kerbal Space Program, now, years later the gaming videos are less important and the pure science is the main thrust. My degrees are all in Physics and Astronomy, so much of the rocket science and engineering I've learned is self taught, always learning, always teaching. I'm not a professional youtuber, I have a day job in software development which means I won't take lame sponsored content, or tell you to sign up for affiliate services to make a quick buck. However lots of generous people have asked to support my hobby via Patreon and I'm grateful to those individuals. Also occasionally shares cute videos of his kids.

Have you ever been confused by mathematics? No matter how hard you try, it seems that it's all just a jungle of meaningless definitions and processes. How is it that some people seem to just get it? On this channel, I help to make math make sense. There are generally two kinds of videos on this channel. The first kind are those that take a topic and explain it in a way that makes sense. They generally teach the same things that you learn in other places. However, there are some topics where the traditional way of formalizing it obfuscates the core idea. This leads to the second kind of video: those that introduce new ways of doing old things. Examples of things in this category is using τ instead of π and using geometric algebra (which is a major theme on the channel).

Each clip provides an intimate peek into the lives of these extraordinary animals so that we may understand and appreciate their uniqueness and breathtaking beauty. My work is the culmination of countless hours spent in the ocean, primarily among dolphins and whales. My focus has always been to establish a heart-based connection by extending positive intention, healing energy, and reverence to our cousins in the sea. It has only been in the past ten years that I have carried a camera into this sacred realm in order to share the essence of these connections with others. Every species on Earth serves a vital role in our planet's health and well being. We protect what we care about. It is my sincere hope that you will fall in love with the whales, dolphins, and other marine life depicted in these videos. All the best to you, Susan

Theories of Everything with Curt Jaimungal
@TheoriesofEverything•338K subscribers
Exploring theoretical physics, consciousness, Ai, and God in a technically rigorous manner. If you'd like to support this endeavor, then please visit the Patreon ( https://patreon.com/curtjaimungal ). Thank you for your charitable and kindhearted support. My name's Curt Jaimungal, a Torontonian with a degree in mathematical physics from the University of Toronto and I analyze various Theories of Everything from this analytic perspective, though more and more opening up to alternative approaches. The separating factor of TOE from other podcasts is its focus on depth even at the risk of limiting the audience due to how much detail we delve into subjects. Paralleling the intensity found in academic discourse, we're increasingly embracing a spectrum of unconventional ideas to conduct research during this podcast, rather than merely conveying existing information.

After surviving corporate tech hell, I'm sharing insights from my biggest wins and losses. If you're struggling to grow (or just survive) in your tech career - I've been there. I started out in QA and was promoted to a software architect way too early at just 23 years old. That's when the political games hit! It was a fight of every developer for himself from there on out... About 20 years later I suffered from chronic burnout. I lost my job, my savings - and almost my marriage. But it taught me what matters - and who I really am. The IT industry has many problems, and sometimes they can't be fixed. But we can fix ourselves! Today I offer tech professionals all over the world integrated career and life coaching, and courses to help them succeed without burning out. I can help you improve your mindset and mental health, lean into your strengths, and if it's time - start working for yourself. Subscribe and join us - let’s help each other grow a community of thriving technologists!

Hi everyone, welcome to TierZoo, the web show which seeks to analyze the meta to determine the best current builds. I talk about the special abilities and build strats of various prominent animal classes and show people things they may have overlooked when specing their character. Okay but actually my goal is to get gamers interested in zoology, since there's a ton of amazing aspects of life on Earth that go underappreciated. Evolution has produced some bizarre traits, strategies, and life cycles that I feel need to be given the spotlight once in a while. I don't shy away from keeping the brutal with the beautiful, so if you're new to my content, be warned. Expect two videos per month. The good thing about my topic is that there's potentially limitless content and I'm more than willing to provide it. Hit me up with all of your suggestions! I've gotten some amazing ones so far.

UnHerd
@UnHerd•423K subscribers
As you may have guessed from our strange spelling, UnHerd aims to do two things: to push back against the herd mentality with new and bold thinking, and to provide a platform for otherwise unheard ideas, people and places. We think this approach is more needed than ever. Societies across the West are divided and stuck, and the established media is struggling to make sense of what’s happening. The governing ideologies of the past generation are too often either unquestioningly defended or rejected wholesale. It’s easy and safe to be in one or other of these two camps – defensive liberal or angry reactionary - but UnHerd is trying to do something different, and harder. We want to be bold enough to identify those things that have been lost, as well as gained, by the liberal world order of the past thirty years; but we strive to be always thoughtful rather than divisive. Welcome to UnHerd. We hope you find something that makes you think again. https://linktr.ee/unherdtv
