# Everything
 
Not really everything.  Should probably read "an accumulation of a lot of code" but that's not as catchy.

Proprietary computer vision stuff is in another repo.  
Thesis reinforcement learning stuff is in another repo.


There's a netcat program that can be used as an instant messanger.  One of the instances has to be listening.

./a.out -l 127.0.0.1 3490
./a.out 127.0.0.1 3490

pl_mpeg is an mpeg_1 video player that uses SDL and opengl.  Could be useful for embedding video into a game or something.
Its readme details how to generate an mpeg1 video file using VLC.  It's surprisingly watchable.  
File sizes seem to be 2-3 times bigger than usual.


There's some python code with some jupyter notebooks, machine learning demos, and some openai server stuff.
There's 
* a pareto distribution generator meant to model a simple economic model.
* a graphical kmeans demo
* a markov chain language generator
