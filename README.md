Static web stuff is at nicolas42.github.io
Proprietary computer vision stuff is in another repo.  
Thesis reinforcement learning stuff is in another repo.


There's a netcat program that can be used as an instant messanger.  One of the instances has to be listening.

./a.out -l 127.0.0.1 3490
./a.out 127.0.0.1 3490

pl_mpeg is an mpeg_1 video player that uses SDL and opengl.  Could be useful for embedding video into a game or something.

File sizes seem to be 2-3 times bigger than usual.

There's some machine learning demos.  A bit of openai stuff.

There's some python code which is neat.

a pareto distribution generator meant to model a simple economic model.
a visual kmeans demo
a markov chain language generator
